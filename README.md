## 📖 Project Description

DataSci Assistant is transforming the data analysis process. Through an interactive interface, users can upload datasets, get interpretations, visualize data, and even get suggestions for machine learning models.

**🛠 Technologies Used:**
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API
- Pandas

**🚧 Challenges Faced:**
- Navigating the intricacies of the OpenAI API, especially prompt engineering.
- Ensuring accurate interpretations of diverse datasets.

**🔜 Future Improvements:**
- Integration of more specialized LLMs (Language Models) for specific data domains to enhance accuracy and relevance.

## 🔧 Installation

1. 📥 Ensure all prerequisites required by Streamlit and Pandas are installed.
2. 🔑 Obtain a key for the OpenAI API.
3. 📦 Install OpenAI and other dependencies.

## 🚀 Usage

Post-installation, users can upload their datasets. The app will then provide interpretations, visualization suggestions, machine learning model suggestions, and more.

## ✨ Features

- **📋 Dataset Interpretation:** 
  * **Gathering Information:** The app engages with the dataset to provide a comprehensive interpretation.
  * **Visualization Suggestions:** Based on the dataset, the app suggests potential visualizations.
  * **Machine Learning Model Suggestions:** The app can suggest potential machine learning models based on the dataset.
